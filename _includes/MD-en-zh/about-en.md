**Bio**

I'm **Zhang Bohua(Oscar Zhang)**, a Ph.D. candidate in Xi'an Jiaotong University.

My **research interest** involves computer vision, pattern recognition, deep learning, video classification and scene understanding.

Besides, I enjoy the simple pleasures of life, especially in PC DIY, IT techs, raising a cat, swimming and eating hotpot. I often help my friends in resolving issues of PC hardware and software, reinforcing the public sense of `computer science = computer requiring`.
